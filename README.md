# CrimeWatch â€“ FBI Most Wanted Tracker

## Description

**CrimeWatch** is a single-page JavaScript web app that connects to the FBI's Most Wanted API to display a real-time list of fugitives currently wanted by the FBI. Users can browse fugitive cards, read case details, and submit sightings through a secure form.
